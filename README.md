## How I used Gemini CLI

I used the Gemini CLI to help me build and modify the To-Do CLI application. I used it to create, edit, and run files, as well as to get help with code and to add features to the application. I also used it for:

- Refactoring the code
- Fixing bugs
- Improving the UI
- Adjusting the code
- Modifying the code if needed
